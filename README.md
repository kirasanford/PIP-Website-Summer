#PIP: Producing Inventory from the Peculiar

During the summer, I was a part of an Entrepreneurship program where students create innovative solutions to realistic problems. My groups project was reduced produce waste at the border. Our focus was Nogales Arizona Port of Entry, the largest port of entry for fresh produce imports from Mexico. Our project seeks to use rejected produce to create jams, jellies, marmalades, and salsas allowing the produce to have a longer shelf life and be distributed at wider ranges. Here is the website to the project, though there is room for improvement.
